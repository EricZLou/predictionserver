# Servers

Terminology used for classes providing permission based access to redis keys and other functionality.

Server classes are designed to be independently testable, and combinable in numerous ways. 

Most derive from private habits. 

Private habits, in turn, derive from one or more of: 
- microconventions
- rediz/futureconventions
